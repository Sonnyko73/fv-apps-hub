Section 2: Explanation What We Do
We build specialized business applications that solve real problems for online stores and service businesses.
Every app in our catalog is designed to address a specific gap in your business stack—whether that's preserving your SEO rankings during store migrations, automating repetitive tasks, or integrating systems that weren't meant to work together.
Unlike generic solutions, our apps are built with deep platform knowledge and real-world merchant feedback. We focus on tools that deliver immediate value, work reliably behind the scenes, and integrate seamlessly with the platforms you already use.
